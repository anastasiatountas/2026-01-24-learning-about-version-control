Learning about Version Control

Attempting to edit the file through the web interface Success!
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

Opinions: 

What I like most about version control is that you can go back in time and look at the commit history and potentially revert back to previous versions of your project. I also like how people can make pull requests and that everyone has to accept the changes before they are fully commited to the remote branch. What I find challenging about version control is working with the different branches. Very glad I am practicing that now.
